clean up code (delete debug printing or systematize it)

make a package that installs

set up test suite [need regression testing, to detect if errors cause
stuff to stop working]

add routine to accept a list of points to be removed from NN data, and
remove them; substituting replacement data if available, else just
drop the data; local fixups might or might not work easily or reliably
vs re-doing whole thing?

add routine to make a list of points to be removed.  Eg: (1) delete
points within a given distance of each other, replacing with their
average; (2) given distance could be a fraction of overall size; (3)
for a given point, delete some of the points closest to it if their
distances are a small fraction of the constellation size; (4) for a
given point, remove (ie delist but not delete) some points from its NN
list, if the distances are larger than a fraction of overall size or
of constellation size;
